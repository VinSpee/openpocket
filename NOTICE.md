The factory NAM models (`engine/px_nam_factory.h`, v37) are A2-Lite networks trained by OpenPocket from Neural Amp
Modeler community captures ([pelennor2170/NAM_models](https://github.com/pelennor2170/NAM_models), GPL v3; authors
in `docs/NAM.md`) played with DI guitar from [Alec-Wright/Automated-GuitarAmpModelling](https://github.com/Alec-Wright/Automated-GuitarAmpModelling)
(GPL v3). The NAM A2 architecture is from Neural Amp Modeler (Steven Atkinson, MIT); `engine/px_nam.c`,
`tools/nam_a2.py` and `tools/train_a2.py` are written for OpenPocket from the published architecture.

Sound models: the names refer to the gear that inspired each voicing (circuit analyses published by ElectroSmash,
Electric Druid, R.G. Keen / GEOFEX, Rob Robinette, Duncan's Tone Stack Calculator; speaker data sheets; manufacturers'
manuals). All trademarks belong to their owners; OpenPocket is not affiliated with Donner, M-VAVE or any gear maker.

No part of the official Pocket X / BlackBox firmware is in this repository. The installer's way back to the official
firmware uses the file you download from the maker; it is checked in your browser and never uploaded.
