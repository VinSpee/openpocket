# Rescuing a crash-looping BlackBox from a Mac (no extra hardware)

Use this when the pedal restarts in a loop and the installer's rescue mode cannot finish. Between crashes the pedal sits
about 44 seconds in the JieLi mask-ROM USB boot state ("UBOOT": USB 4C4A:8057, shown by macOS as `WL80UBOOT1.00`). The
mask ROM is chip ROM, so it cannot be damaged. `tools/uboot_rescue.py` waits for that state, loads JieLi's RAM loader and
rewrites the app area of the flash from the official package, then restarts the pedal.

## One-time setup (macOS)

```
brew install libusb
```

That is all. The tool is one Python 3 file that calls libusb through `ctypes` (no `pip install`). It needs two files:

- The official package, `~/Documents/BlackBox (2).fwsc` (BlackBox_016) by default, or `--package FILE.fwsc`, or a raw flash
  image with `--image flash.bin`. Every CRC of a package is checked before it is used.
- JieLi's `wl82loader.bin`, downloaded once into the git-ignored `build/cache/` from kagaimiq/jl-uboot-tool (commit
  `c32b28e`, the same pin as `flash/installer-fm1buddy-pocketx.bat`) and checked against SHA-256
  `d41da6126760c9d66660bcc0cac8d27d221806c5e369a8036921efe68dca5376` on every run. It is not in this repository. `make clean`
  removes the cache; `--loader FILE` uses a copy you downloaded yourself.

## The two commands

macOS keeps its own mass-storage driver on the pedal in this state, and libusb needs root to take the interface from it.
Plug the pedal straight into the Mac (no hub), start the command, and it waits for the pedal and starts by itself the moment
it appears.

1. **Read-only first.** Nothing is written to the pedal's flash; the loader goes to RAM only.

```
sudo python3 tools/uboot_rescue.py
```

It checks that the pedal answers INQUIRY as `WL82 UBOOT1.00`, loads the loader, reads the chip key (must be `0x980F`) and
the flash id (must be a 1 MiB flash), saves a backup of the whole flash to `~/OpenPocket-rescue/blackbox-<time>.dump.bin`,
compares the pedal's head `[0, 0x4000)` with the image's, reports how many sectors differ, and sends run-app. Keep this
backup: it is the only copy of what the pedal held before the rescue.

2. **The rescue**, only after the read-only run has passed:

```
sudo python3 tools/uboot_rescue.py --write
```

Same steps, then for every 4 KiB sector in `[0x4000, 0xA3000)` that differs: erase, write, read back, compare. When it prints
`Done`, power-cycle the pedal. If the pedal drops out of UBOOT in the middle (it reboots into the crashing app and comes
back), the tool waits and starts again by itself; running it again later also resumes. Only the sectors that still differ are
written, so a rerun is short.

Options: `--package`, `--image`, `--loader`, `--backup-dir DIR`, `--attempts N` (UBOOT windows to try, default 10).
Exit codes: 0 done, 1 setup problem (libusb, root, files), 2 refused by a safety check, 130 stopped by Ctrl-C.

## Safety rules

- The default is read-only. Writing needs `--write`.
- Writes are limited to whole 4 KiB sectors in `[0x4000, end of the image)`; for the BlackBox package that is
  `[0x4000, 0xA3000)`. The end comes from the package and can never be above `0xFF000`. The head `[0, 0x4000)` (header,
  second-stage boot loader, chip key) and everything above the image (Bluetooth trims, user data) are never touched.
- Only a fixed list of loader commands can be sent. Chip erase (`FB02`) and key burn (`FC12`) are not on it. In a read-only
  run the erase and write commands are not on it either.
- It stops without writing when the device is not `WL82 UBOOT1.00`, the chip key is not `0x980F`, the flash is not 1 MiB, or
  the pedal's head differs from the image's head (a package for another layout).
- The backup is complete on disk before the first erase.
- After a restore, do not reinstall the Bluetooth test image until the cause of the crash loop is understood: the loop came
  from that image.

## If it does not work

| Symptom | Cause and next step |
| --- | --- |
| `libusb not found` | `brew install libusb` (or set `LIBUSB_PATH`). |
| `cannot take the interface from macOS (LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS)` | Run the command with `sudo`. |
| Waits forever | The pedal is not in UBOOT right now. It is there about 44 s out of every 70 s while it loops; check `ioreg -p IOUSB` for `WL80UBOOT1.00`, a data cable and a direct port. |
| `REFUSED` | A safety check stopped it; the message names which. Nothing was written. |
| `gave up after N tries` | The pedal kept leaving UBOOT before the run could finish. Rerun: it resumes. |
| Still nothing | The SD-card recovery in `flash/` (fm1buddy on an ESP32-S3) is the other route. |

[konsumer/fm1buddy](https://github.com/konsumer/fm1buddy) (GPL-3.0); `tools/uboot_rescue.py` is a new implementation of the
same commands for macOS. Tests: `make rescue-check` runs it against a simulated pedal (`tests/uboot_sim.py`), with no hardware.
